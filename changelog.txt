(05/03/2025) - version 0.7.6a

- std conditions now does compare integers too, when type is not a number;
- @0 is now type.any instead of type.number;
- fixed some function args related problems;
- fixed if undeclared in std;
- fixed string format '$' related problems and added some error messages;
- new experimental hash operator =, it beahave as #new if no hash is found, and as set: if a hash is found;
- usage: name=value or name=(fn ...) or name@number@name=value, it should have no spaces between the name and the operator;

(03/03/2025) - version 0.7.6

- this version gives more independence to the interpreter, it allow it to do functions and switches without the need of the std;
- std files unified;
- defining @0 as NULL is now done in the std;
- make_int_list, make_string_list and make_char_list removed;
- != and == now dont just compare the pointers/integers, but compare the values;
- function function removed, use : instead, it does exactly the same thing;
- interpreter behavior changed, function now instead of (: varnames... "code") is (: (: varnames...) "code");
- new kind of function, the lookup (table): (: (: varnames...) (: values...) default);
- the third element of the lookup table is the default value, if the lookup fails it will return it;
- format function removed, "" and '' strings now support escape codes using \whatever and variables using $varname;
- the new formatter also suport $(whatever "code" etc);
- you can now use varname@index to get the element at the index;
- you can now use varname@name to get the element named "name" from a lookup table;
- you can also use varname@name@index... etc;
- now conditions instead of return @1 it will return the first argument, except in case the first argument is @0, in this case it will look the other args, if all are zero it will return @1 instead;
- in case of false it still returns @0;
- removed string_split.br example, it can be done manually;
- new delimiter (: ) to create lists, list was the only type beside type.any that needed a function to be created, now it can be done directly;
- script calls doesnt have a own scope anymore, thats now a exclusive behavior of functions;
- math functions now work with integers as well;
- dynamic libraries are now a thing, just create a regular bruter lib and load with dl.open, bruter will do the rest;
- new functions dl.open and dl.close, they are the only functions that arent part of the std, they are registered in main.c, useful when you compile the interpreter withou any lib;
- new build.sh flag: --clean, it ignores all files in lib/ and compile a libless interpreter;
- no more --exclude in build.sh, use --clean, or simply delete the files from lib/ before compiling;

(19/02/2025) - version 0.7.5c

(14/02/2025) - version 0.7.5b

- new function #priority, it reorder the hash in the hashes list, the first argument is the hash name, the second is the priority, 0 is the max priority, if it receive only 1 arg it sets the minimum priority, which is 10 by default, if no args are passed it will return the priority of the hash;
- some memory leaking fixed;
- some optimizations on loops, while is about ~50% faster now, and repeat is about ~20% faster;
- #new still working for re-setting a hash, but is not recommended unless you know exactly what you are doing, some optimizations now expect static hashes;
- some internal systems were splited in minor parts and some changed behavior, just internal stuff;
- new file c_list.h;
- all stack_* functions were renamed to list_* instead, usage is now simpler and you dont need to allocate the list anymore, list_init does it now;

- new internal list macro: list_double, it reallocs the list to double its size;
- new internal list macro: list_half, it reallocs the list to half its size;

- std_inplace.c removed;

- some optimizations in math functions;
- new function "$" aka deplace, it make destructive operations non-destructive(e.g. #new "c" ($ + a b) will not change a);

- removed "or" function, you can replicate it with bruter code;
- removed "#set" and "#rename";
- new function "#new", just like #set but it will always create a new hash, deleting the existing one before, keep that in mind;
